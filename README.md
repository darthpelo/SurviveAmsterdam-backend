# SurviveAmsterdam-backend

## Swift backend demo with Perfect.
This project it is a simply demo to show how to deploy a
REST API services using [Perfect](https://www.perfect.org) on Heroku. What is it Perfect?

 _Perfect is a web server and toolkit for developers using the Swift programming language to build applications and other REST services._

Starting from this Perfect [example](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-Heroku-Buildpack-Example) I decided to create very basic REST services for a my side project [SurviveAmsterdam](), to show you how is possible to create Backend and Mobile using only `Swift`.

## Disclaimer
1) I am not a backend developer, my background is hardware, firmware and iOS, so feel free to give me suggestions or create pull request
